## About The Project

The NoCode Platform using MOI's Cocolang Contracts is a groundbreaking solution that empowers users to create dynamic websites without any coding knowledge. This platform leverages MOI's Cocolang Contracts for secure and transparent interactions, ensuring user-generated content is stored as NFTs on the blockchain. With a drag-and-drop interface, AI-powered code assistance, and an integrated NFT marketplace, users can craft, edit, and trade their websites seamlessly.

### Project Motivation

Traditional website development often requires coding expertise, creating a barrier for non-technical users. The motivation behind this project is to democratize website creation, allowing anyone to design, modify, and share websites without writing code. The integration of MOI's Cocolang Contracts ensures data security, immutability, and tokenization of user creations.

### Key Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Website Creation:** Users can visually design websites by dragging and dropping elements onto the canvas.
- **Visual HTML Editing:** Edit HTML code visually using an intuitive interface with real-time preview.
- **AI-Powered Assistance:** An integrated chatbot offers code generation and problem-solving assistance.
- **Open-Source Templates:** Export and import open-source website templates for customization.
- **NFT Integration:** User-created websites are stored as NFTs, allowing for ownership and trading.
- **NFT Marketplace:** Buy and sell website templates and designs within the platform's marketplace.
